# 🍝 Ragoo /ræɡˈuː/
> Like the pasta dish.

## Overview
Create Agents and RAG workflows with little to no code.

- Experiment with creating Agents and RAG workflows with only YAML configuration.
- Extend those experiments into full applications by adding tools and (optionally) writing some code.

## Includes
- Composable workflows which can be exposed as simple API endpoints or run on schedules.
- Plugins for various services such as vector databases, LLMs, and data importers.

## More information
See [the example config file](./ragoo.yaml) to get started.

Requires Go 1.22 to build. Default configuration uses Ollama for easy demonstration.
