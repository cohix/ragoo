# Ragoo /ræɡˈuː/

Like the pasta dish.

Create Agents and RAG workflows with little to no code.

Experiment with creating Agents and RAG workflows with only YAML configuration.

Extend experiments to become applications by adding tools and (optionally) writing some code.

Plugins for various services such as vector databases, LLMs, and data importers.

Composable workflows which can be exposed as simple API endpoints or run on schedules.

See [the example config file](.ragoo.yaml) to get started.

Requires Go 1.22 to build. Default configuration uses Ollama for easy demonstration.
